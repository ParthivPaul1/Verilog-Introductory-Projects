# Verilog-Introductory-Projects
Here I have tried to implement my verilog knowledge to design simple combinational and sequential circuits. Starting from half adder to counter-registers, I tried to cover most of the theoritical knowledge in digital circuits in this repository. This practice will help me to design simple digital systems using RTL logic.
Here I have used Xilinx Vivado Software to implement the verilog code and test bench in the text editor. The constraint file has been used for implementation of the digital circuits in Basys-3 FPGA board to inpect the system physically.
The github link for the constraint file is given:
