# Verilog-Introductory-Projects
Here I have tried to implement my verilog knowledge to design simple combinational and sequential circuits. Starting from half adder to counter-registers, I tried to cover most of the theoritical knowledge in digital circuits in this repository. This practice will help me to design simple digital systems using RTL logic.
